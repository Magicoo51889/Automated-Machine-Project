# Automated-Machine-Project
This is a project for school:
Copington Adventure Theme Park has just purchased an automated ticketing system and would like you to program the interface for customers to use. The ticketing system should ask the customer various questions about their visit requirements before providing a total charge, asking for payment and issuing a ticket.
