# Automated-Machine-Project
This is a project for school as part of my GCSE CS class:
Copington Adventure Theme Park has just purchased an automated ticketing system and would like you to program the interface for customers to use. The ticketing system should ask the customer various questions about their visit requirements before providing a total charge, asking for payment and issuing a ticket.

The aim of the project had multiple needs for the program and then 3 'nice to haves'. The program has 2 of the nice to haves before I hit the deadline to complete it by. 

In the project I hit a few barriers involving the scope of functions, but after a while of trial and error I managed to get it to work and learned that making a function to create variables that is needed for other funtions doesn't work and that it causes the error of it being in the outer scope for other functions.
